# Group Chat with Socket.io, Express, and Node.js

This is a real-time **group chat application** built with **Socket.io**, **Express**, and **Node.js**. The app allows users to create or join rooms for private group chats. It uses **HTML**, **CSS**, **jQuery**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend, and **Node.js** with **Socket.io** for real-time communication.

## Features

- **Room System:** Users can create a room with a unique link and share it with others.
- **Real-time Messaging:** Messages are instantly sent and received using Socket.io.
- **File Sharing (Without Storage):** Users can send files along with messages, but files are not stored on the server.
- **Copy Room Link:** Users can copy and share the unique room link easily.
- **Auto Room Cleanup:** If no users are in a room for **5 minutes**, the room is automatically removed.
- **Responsive UI:** Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Broadcasting Messages:** Messages are sent to all connected users in the same room (except the sender).
