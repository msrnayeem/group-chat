# Group Chat with Socket.io, Express, and Node.js

This is a basic real-time **group chat application** built with **Socket.io**, **Express**, and **Node.js**. The app allows multiple users to communicate in real-time using a chat interface. It uses **HTML**, **CSS**, **jQuery**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend, and **Node.js** with **Socket.io** for handling real-time communication.

## Features

- **Real-time Messaging:** Chat messages are instantly sent and received by all connected users using Socket.io.
- **File Sharing (Without Storage):** Users can send files along with messages, but files are not stored on the server.
- **Simple UI:** A clean, simple chat interface built with basic HTML and CSS.
- **Responsive:** The app is responsive and should work well on mobile devices.
- **Broadcasting Messages:** Messages are broadcasted to all connected users except the sender.
